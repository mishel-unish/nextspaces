					Sheet piles are sections of sheet materials with interlocking

					and excavation support. Sheet piles are most commonly made of
					steel, but can also be formed of timber or reinforced concrete.

				<p>
					Sheet piles are commonly used for retaining walls, land

					Next Spaces is experienced in designing and building hard/soft,
					hard/firm and hard/hard secant walls using continuous flight
					auger techniques or segmental casings for applications of 750mm
					pile diameters upwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development of powerful high torque drilling equipment has
					led to an increase in the range of ground conditions and
					obstructions that can be penetrated and the wall thicknesses that
					can be constructed. We are therefore able to install secant walls
					in the most challenging urban environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where soils are saturated and water tightness is a requirement,
					secant walls using either bentonite cement materials (soft) or
					weaker concrete (firm) are used in combination with reinforced
					concrete (hard) piles. These alternatives are generally used
					where temporary works are required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Permanent retention can be provided with all reinforced piles
					(hard/hard), which can be incorporated within the final
					structure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Piles in a secant wall are spaced at 0.8 to 0.9 pile diameters.
					Primary piles are secant by secondary piles, thus providing a
					closed structure to act as a barrier in water bearing soils, and
					to prevent the ingress of soil between the piles.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-0">
					Secant piling offers minimal vibration, low noise levels and the
					flexibility to fit complex site boundaries to maximise land use.
					Secant piling also has the ability to go through underground
					obstructions such as steel, heavily reinforced concrete, granite
					and masonry, while at the same time, avoiding any risk of
					construction induced settlements to neighbouring structures.

					This process of blending soil with selected materials can produce
					a modified or re‐engineered soil that has strength,
					non‐permeability and/or elasticity. The process is achieved by
					installing specialised jetting equipment down conventionally

					great flexibility in the choice of borehole entry points which
					allows the formation below ground to consist of complex
					geometrical shapes of treatment by combination of overlapping
					individual treatment zones. This can be particularly useful in
					the built up urban environment where both surface and underground

					Diaphragm walls provide rigid, cost effective solutions for
					permanent retaining walls and shafts, with less construction
					joints than bored pile walls. They are particularly suitable for
					large, more open sites where structures greater than 25m deep are
					required. The underground diaphragm wall technique offers
					improved verticality tolerances to CFA and rotary bored piling,
					up to 1:400 for hydrofraise, and delivers a smoother finish.
					Water tightness is normally delivered using a CWS water bar
					between the diaphragm wall panels.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-0">
					Diaphragm walls are constructed as permanent walls, which reduces
					the width of construction and working space required when
					compared to a solution that has both a temporary ground support
					and permanent works within. Walls can be made extremely stiff and
					therefore better resistant to deflection. It is also possible to
					use effective internal propping with a diaphragm wall rather than
					the normal ground anchors. Temporary cut‐offs can also be created
					using this technique.

					It is a permanent anchorage formed using a single corrosion
					protected anchor, grouted within a Tube a Manchette (TaM) pipe,

					second layer of corrosion protection whilst also facilitating the
					injection of grout into the surrounding soil. The grout permeates
					into and consolidates the soil, permitting a greater bond
					strength between the soil and the TaM pipe that could not be
					otherwise achieved between the soil and the anchor alone. The
					system provides a high level of corrosion resistance coupled with
					a high load pull out capacity.
